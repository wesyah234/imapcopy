# imapcopy

*imapcopy* is a command-line tool written in [PHP](http://php.net/) to
recursively copy all e-mail messages and folders from one
[IMAP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Message_Access_Protocol) account to
another.

The purpose of *imapcopy* is either to be run directly on the source or the
destination mail server, or at least remotely on a data-center server with a
very high bandwidth. This allows you to do a fast server-to-server migration
instead of using a client like Thunderbird, first downloading everything and
then uploading it again through a relatively slow home DSL connection.

*imapcopy* has successfully been tested with a
[Courier IMAP](http://www.courier-mta.org/imap/)-to-[Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)
migration of multiple IMAP accounts, one of which was 17 GB in size containing
over 30,000 e-mail with lots of huge attachments stored across over 450 folders.

## Features

* Recursively copy all e-mail messages and folders across servers
* Copy multi-part messages including all their attachments
* Preserve the date and status of messages including
  * Unread/read
  * Answered
  * Flagged
  * Deleted
  * Draft
* Optionally auto-remove invalid spaces from folder names
* Support different folder separators for source and destination, e.g. `.` and
`/`
* Exclude specific folders from being copied
* Re-locate the folder structure as a whole
  * Get it out of a sub-folder from the source
  * Put it into an arbitrary sub-folder in the destination
* Map individual source folders to different destination folders
* Merge multiple source folders into one destination folder
* Start/continue copying at a specific folder or message
* Copy only specific folders or even specific messages in folders
* SSL support
* Optionally ignore invalid SSL certificates
* Perform a test run with no changes made to the destination
* Generous console output showing the progress and details for logging and
debugging
* Support for large mailboxes - breaks them into smaller pieces

## Requirements

* [PHP](http://php.net/) 5.3.2+ command-line interpreter
* PHP extensions: [IMAP](http://php.net/manual/en/book.imap.php) and
[Multibyte String](http://php.net/manual/en/book.mbstring.php) (mbstring)
* *On the user:*
  * Knowledge about the
[JSON notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) (see *Configuration*)
  * Shell access (although it is possible, better not run *imapcopy* from your
browser... ;-) )

## Download

You can download the latest version as a [ZIP
file](https://github.com/wrzlbrmft/imapcopy/archive/master.zip) from GitHub.

## Usage

*imapcopy* is run from the command-line using the PHP command-line interpreter.
The configuration is passed as a mandatory file name parameter, pointing to the
configuration file (see *Configuration*).

This would load the configuration from the file `config.json`:

```
php imapcopy.php config.json
```

With the optional parameter `-test`, a test run will be performed with no
changes made to the destination:

```
php imapcopy.php config.json -test
```

A test run still produces all the console output of a regular run.

The second optional parameter `-info` leads to an output with information about the folders, i.e. the names and numbers of folders found at the source, and counts the messages inside the folders:

```
php imapcopy.php config.json -info
```

No changes will be made to the destination either.

### Important Tip

Avoid *any* change made to the source IMAP account, until you have completely
copied it to the destination, especially if you need to run *imapcopy* several
times to get the job fully done, e.g. due to errors. This also includes new
incoming messages being delivered to the source IMAP account.

The reason is, that *imapcopy* counts all folders and their messages in the
source IMAP account, before it actually starts copying them. The folder and
message numbers are used to indicate the copying progress.
But you can also use the numbers to start/continue copying at a specific folder
or message or copy only specific folders or even specific messages in folders.
If you make changes to the source IMAP account, the folder and message numbers
might change and you will have a hard time to do things like that if you are in
the middle of a migration.

For more information see also *Migration Best Practice*.

## Configuration

The configuration is provided as a file written using the
[JSON notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).

**Example:**

```json
{
	"src": {
		"hostname": "127.0.0.1",
		"port": 143,
		"username": "john.doe",
		"password": "*****",
		"ssl": false,
		"sslNovalidateCert": false,
		"readOnly": true,
		"folderSeparator": ".",

		"excludedFolders": [
			"INBOX.Drafts",
			"INBOX.Spam",
			"INBOX.Trash"
		],
		"onlyFoldersNum": [1, 2, 3],
		"onlyFolderMessagesNum": {
			"2": [7],
			"3": [8, 9]
		},
		"startFolderNum": 1,
		"startFolderMessageNum": 1
	},
	"dst": {
		"hostname": "imap.gmail.com",
		"port": 993,
		"username": "john.doe@gmail.com",
		"password": "*****",
		"ssl": true,
		"sslNovalidateCert": false,
		"readOnly": false,
		"folderSeparator": "/",

		"trimFolderPath": true,
		"mappedFolders": {
			"INBOX/Sent": "[Gmail]/Gesendet"
		},
		"popFolder": "INBOX",
		"pushFolder": ""
	}
}
```

You can also find the above example in `cli/example.json`.

**NOTE:** The JSON must have a `src` and a `dst` object, otherwise *imapcopy*
will exit with an error.

### Source and Destination Settings

Both the source (`src`) and the destination (`dst`) have these settings in
common:

#### hostname, port, username, password

Set the hostname (or IP address) and the port to connect to the mail server and
add credentials to login to the IMAP account.

**NOTE:** If no port is specified the default IMAP port 143 is used.

#### ssl, sslNovalidateCert

To connect via SSL set `ssl` to `true`. If your mail server certificate is
invalid (e.g. self-signed), you can set `sslNovalidateCert` to `true` so the
certificate is not validated on connect.

#### readOnly

It is a good idea to keep this setting set to `true` for the source account at
any time. Of course, keep it set to `false` for the destination. ;-)

**NOTE:** When doing a test run using the `-test` command-line option, then
the `readOnly` setting of the destination is overwritten with `true`.

#### folderSeparator

Set the folder separator used by the mail server. Typically it is a dot `.`
(e.g. [Courier IMAP](http://www.courier-mta.org/imap/)) or a slash `/` (e.g.
[Gmail](https://mail.google.com/)).

### Source-specific Settings

#### excludedFolders

List folders that you want to exclude from being copied using their full name.

This will exclude `Drafts`, `Spam` and `Trash` under the inbox (`INBOX`):

```
		...
		"excludedFolders": [
			"INBOX.Drafts",
			"INBOX.Spam",
			"INBOX.Trash"
		],
		...
```

If you do not want to exclude any folders, set `excludedFolders` to empty:

```
		...
		"excludedFolders": [],
		...
```

**NOTE:** Excluded folders will not get a folder number for the current run of
*imapcopy* (see also *Folder and Message Numbers*).

#### onlyFoldersNum

If you want to copy only specific folders, then list the numbers of the folders
you want to copy here.

This will copy only the folders number 1, 2 and 3:

```
		...
		"onlyFoldersNum": [1, 2, 3],
		...

```

If you want to copy all folders, set `onlyFoldersNum` to empty:

```
		...
		"onlyFoldersNum": [],
		...

```

**NOTE:** If you use `onlyFoldersNum` in combination with `excludedFolders`,
keep in mind, that excluded folders will not get a folder number for the current
run of *imapcopy* (see also *Folder and Message Numbers*).

#### onlyFolderMessagesNum

If you want to copy only specific messages of a folder, then list the number
of the folder and of its messages you want to copy here.

This will copy only message number 7 of folder number 2 and messages number 8
and 9 of folder number 3:

```
		...
		"onlyFolderMessagesNum": {
			"2": [7],
			"3": [8, 9]
		},
		...
```

If you do not want to copy only specific messages of folders, then set
`onlyFolderMessagesNum` to empty:

```
		...
		"onlyFolderMessagesNum": {},
		...
```

#### Combining onlyFoldersNum and onlyFolderMessagesNum

If you want to copy only specific folders and from *some* of these folders only
specific messages, then you can combine `onlyFoldersNum` and
`onlyFolderMessagesNum`.

This will copy only messages from folders number 1, 2 and 3. Folder number 1
will be copied with all its messages, but *imapcopy* will copy only message
number 7 of folder number 2 and messages number 8 and 9 of folder number 3:

```
		...
		"onlyFoldersNum": [1, 2, 3],
		"onlyFolderMessagesNum": {
			"2": [7],
			"3": [8, 9]
		},
		...
```

**NOTE:** If you combine `onlyFoldersNum` and `onlyFolderMessagesNum`, make sure
that all folders used in `onlyFolderMessagesNum` are also listed in
`onlyFoldersNum`. The following setting will *not* copy any message from folders
number 2 and 3:

```
		...
		"onlyFoldersNum": [1],
		"onlyFolderMessagesNum": {
			"2": [7],
			"3": [8, 9]
		},
		...
```

#### startFolderNum, startFolderMessageNum

If you want to start/continue copying at a specific folder or message, then set
these settings to the appropriate folder or message number.

This will start/continue copying at folder number 3:

```
		...
		"startFolderNum": 3,
		"startFolderMessageNum": 1
		...
```

This will start/continue copying at folder number 3, and *in* folder number 3 at
message number 9:

		...
		"startFolderNum": 3,
		"startFolderMessageNum": 9
		...

**NOTE:** Using `startFolderNum` or `startFolderMessageNum` will not change the
counting of folders and their messages for the current run of *imapcopy* (see
also *Folder and Message Numbers*).

### Destination-specific Settings

#### trimFolderPath

Setting `trimFolderPath` to `true` will remove unnecessary whitespace from
folder names before they are created in the destination:

  * Remove whitespace at both the beginning and end
  * Successive spaces are reduced to just a single space

**NOTE:** If you are migrating to [Gmail](https://mail.google.com/), you need to
set `trimFolderPath` to `true`.

#### mappedFolders

Using `mappedFolders` allows you to map individual source folders to different
destination folders or merge multiple source folders into one destination
folder.

This will copy messages from the source folder `Sent` in the inbox (`INBOX`) to
the folder `Old Sent Mails` in the destination:

```
		...
		"mappedFolders": {
			"INBOX/Sent": "Old Sent Mails"
		},
		...
```

This will merge the source folders `Trash` and `Deleted Messages` in the inbox
(`INBOX`) into the folder `Old Deleted Mails` in the destination.

```
		...
		"mappedFolders": {
			"INBOX/Trash": "Old Deleted Mail",
			"INBOX/Deleted Messages": "Old Deleted Mails"
		},
		...
```

**NOTE:** You must use the folder separator of the destination also for the
source folder names!

If you do not want to map any folders then set `mappedFolders` to empty:

```
		...
		"mappedFolders": {},
		...
```

#### popFolder, pushFolder

Using `popFolder` and `pushFolder` allows you to re-locate the source folder
structure as a whole. `popFolder` can remove parts from the beginning of the
folder name to get it out of a sub-folder from the source. After that,
`pushFolder` can add parts to the beginning of the folder name to put it into an
arbitrary sub-folder in the destination.

This will re-locate all source folders inside the inbox (`INBOX`) to the root
level in the destination:

```
		...
		"popFolder": "INBOX",
		"pushFolder": ""
		...
```

So for example `INBOX/Newsletters` becomes `Newsletters`.

This will re-locate all source folders to the sub-folder `Old Folders` in the
destination:

```
		...
		"popFolder": "",
		"pushFolder": "Old Folders"
		...
```

So for example `Sent` becomes `Old Folders/Sent`.

You can also combine `popFolder` and `pushFolder`. This will re-locate all
source folders inside the inbox (`INBOX`) to the sub-folder `Old Folders` in the
destination:

```
		...
		"popFolder": "INBOX",
		"pushFolder": "Old Folders"
		...
```

So for example `INBOX/Newsletters` becomes `Old Folders/Newsletters`.

**NOTE:** `popFolder` and `pushFolder` are processed *after* folder mappings
using `mappedFolders`.
